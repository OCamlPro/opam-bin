Checking your Airdrop Allocation
================================

An airdrop was performed on September 9, 2019, to replicate accounts
from the Tezos blockchain to Dune Network. For that, a snapshot was
taken at 
`block 600,000 of Tezos <https://tzscan.io/600000>`__.

The following operations were performed:

* All tokens on KT1 accounts were automatically moved to the tz1 manager
* All accounts with less than 10 tokens were removed

If you had an account on Tezos, you can check your balance:

* Take only your Tezos key hashes (tz1)
* Go to the `DunScan block explorer <https://dunscan.io/>`__
* Enter your Tezos key hash (tz1) in the Search bar and hit GO
* DunScan should display an account page with a Dune key hash (dn1)
* In the "Account Details" box, hit the "tz" icon. A Tezos key hash should
  appear below the Dune key hash. You can check it is yours.
* In the same box, the "Balance" field should show your Dune tokens
