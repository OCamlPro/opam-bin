Delegating your Tokens
======================

This section is for the people that want to take part in the protocol that runs
the network without having to deal with the complexity of running a delegate.

Implicit accounts cannot have a delegate, so the first step is to originate an account,
transfer your dun there and set a delegate.

Using the Dune Web Wallet
-------------------------

Refer to the
`this section <using-a-wallet.html#using-the-dune-web-wallet>`__ if you
haven't setup your wallet yet.

The first step is to originate an account and then transfer some dun there :

* Click on "Add account+" in the section "My accounts" on the left
* Wait for the operation to be included in the blockchain

Once this is done, you can use the wallet to send dun to the newly
created "KT1" account:

* Select your main account on the list on the left
* Navigate to the "Send" tab
* Fill the destination field with the KT1 address
  (you can use "My accounts" link to have a select box with you accounts)
* Fill the remaining fields
* Click the "Send" button
* Wait for the operation to be included in the blockchain

Once the operation is included your KT1 account should hold tokens.

Now we can delegate the KT1 account to the delegate that we have chosen:

* Select the KT1 account that you want to delegate on the list on the left
* Navigate to the "Delegate" tab
* Use the select box of the "Delegate Options" field and select "Custom"
* You can enter the dn1 address of the chosen delegate in the
  "Custom Delegate" field
* Click the "Update Delegate" button
* Wait for the operation to be included in the blockchain


Using the Dune Command-line Wallet
----------------------------------

Refer to `this section <using-a-wallet.html#using-the-dune-command-line-wallet>`__ to setup the Dune Command-line Wallet.

With the dune command-line wallet, you can originate a kt1 account,
transfer tokens and delegate with one command::

  dune-client originate account <kt1_alias> for <dn1_alias> transferring <amount> from <dn1_alias> --delegate <delegate_alias> --delegatable

``<kt1_alias>`` specifies the alias of the newly created kt1 account.
``<dn1_alias>`` is the alias of the dn1 account holding the tokens. ``<amount>``
amount that will be send to the kt1 account (in dun). ``--delegate <delegate>``
set the delegate of kt1 account (should be a dn1 address). Since by default an
originated account is not delegatable the option ``--delegatable`` enables the
"set delegate" operation on the kt1 account allowing to change delegate.
