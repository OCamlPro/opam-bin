* We need to handle carefully ocaml-base-compiler (the opam file is named
    ocaml-variants.opam)
* For meta packages (packages without sources), we need to create the
    opam file ex-nihilo

* is the build-id really useful ? it sounds like we won't use it.
* for dependencies, we need to keep track of the md5sum of the binary archive
   for correct dependencies. store them in .opam-switch/server/$NAME.$VERSION
   

Packages that we should put in our repository:

* infer
* coq
* why3
* alt-ergo
* frama-c
* tezos/dune
* ocsigen
* frama-c
* bap
* opam
* opam-user-setup, ocp-indent
* reason
* js_of_ocaml

Look at fdopen
