(* We check:
   * if `_bincached/` exists, we have found a binary archive in the
     cache. We go in that directory where we should find:
     * `bin-package.version`: we should move this file to
       "%{prefix}%/etc/opam-bin/packages/%{name}%". Once the file has been
       moved, we use its absence as a marker that we shouldn't redo the
       installation
     * `bin-package.config`: optional. to be copied into
      "%{prefix}%/.opam-switch/config/%{name}%.config"
     * a directory: it is the content of the binary archive, to be copied
      into "%{prefix}%"
   * if `_binsource` exists, we are in a source archive and should exec
      the installation steps

   NOTE: we could move the installation part in a pre-install command.
